# Tictactoe
the AI enabled Tic Tac Toe game

## Current Status:
The game can be played by two players or versus an AI but there is no option to choose between X and O, player 1 by default will be assigned X. Also a little bootstrap has been added but there are a few bugs

## Future Development
- Option to take the desired outcome
- Better UI/UX for increased interactivity
